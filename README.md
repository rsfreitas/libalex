# libgrc

An Allegro GUI extensions library.

Libgrc is a library to manipulate Allegro DIALOGs trough UI resource files,
in JSON format. The user may define all objects and behavior from a dialog
without write a single line of code. GRC stands for GUI Resource file.

The library allows that outside functions may be assigned to an object and
called within an event.
